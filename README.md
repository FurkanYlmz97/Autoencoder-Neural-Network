# Autoencoder-Neural-Network
In this repository I have implemented an autoencoder neural network with a single hidden layer for unsupervised feature extraction from natural images.

For this sake the following cost function have been minimized:

For this part without changing the 𝛽 and 𝜌 values I have retrained my network. First, I have taken λ=10−3 and retrained the network two times for 𝐿ℎ𝑖𝑑=10 and 𝐿ℎ𝑖𝑑=100 the output results are as following.
